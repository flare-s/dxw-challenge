# dxw-challenge

Make a start on building a UK Government acronym search, that allows users to search for an acronym, and will return the matching organisation for that acronym, if one exists.

## Getting Started

To run this project please type the following commands:

### `npm i`

This will install all the necessary dependencies.

### `npm start`

This will start the app on a development server. 

## User stories

- [x] When the user first loads the application, they are presented with a free text search
box.

- [x] When they search for an acronym, the application displays the full organisation
name for that acronym if one exists.

- [x] If no such acronym exists, an appropriate message is displayed.

- [x] An autocomplete is available on the search box, so that as a user begins to type
acronyms that match the letters they entered are presented in a dropdown.

- [x] Partial matching is available (e.g. if a user searches for “DC”, results are returned for
both “DCMS” and “DCLG”).
